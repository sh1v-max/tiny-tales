# In this project i have been implemented react to do following task:- 

* 1.On first load, only has a Submit button
* 2.On clicking on Submit, it will fetch the contents of https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt
* 3.Parse the content and find the frequency of occurrence of each word (some words will occur only once, some   twice and so on, and some will occur N times)
* 4.Then on the frontend, plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.
* 5.Also build an "Export" button, which when clicked will download a CSV file of the histogram data.
X-axis = top 20 words with highest occurrence Y-axis = how many times they occurred in the file
