# In this project i have been implemented react to do following task:- 

* 1.On first load, only has a Submit button
* 2.On clicking on Submit, it will fetch the contents of https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt
* 3.Parse the content and find the frequency of occurrence of each word (some words will occur only once, some   twice and so on, and some will occur N times)
* 4.Then on the frontend, plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.
* 5.Also build an "Export" button, which when clicked will download a CSV file of the histogram data.
X-axis = top 20 words with highest occurrence Y-axis = how many times they occurred in the file

 ReactJs offers us a great variety of libraries, plug-ins and modules for us to work upon.
ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used by developers to create dynamic and interactive UI components. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them when the underlying data changes.

React follows a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into small, self-contained components. Each component can have its own state, properties, and lifecycle methods. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render only the necessary parts of the user interface, resulting in better performance.
